## About Panunote

PanuNote is useful for students, especially those 
who frequently take notes in class and convert them into quizzes as it can help in 
predicting the kind of questions that the instructors might ask during a test. The findings 
indicate that the PanuNote can improve students' memory retention, particularly for those 
students who regularly have tests.

### Features

- Note-to-quiz generation. Using machine learning, the system would convert 
notes into quizzes with the option for the user to select the quiz type (e.g., multiple choice 
and other types of questions).
